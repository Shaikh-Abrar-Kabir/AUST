                       <h4>In this paper, the bit error rate (BER) performance of SFBC-OFDM systems for frequency selective fading channels is observed for various antenna orientations and modulation schemes. The objective is to find out a suitable configuration with minimum number of receiving antenna that requires minimum signal power level at the receiver to provide reliable voice and video communication. We have considered both M-ary phase shift keying (MPSK) and M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (MQAM) in the performance analysis considering both perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI). The authors have expressed the BER under imperfect channel estimation condition as a function of BER under perfect channel condition in this paper. The finding shows, for a BTS with 4 transmitting antenna and MS with 2 receiving antenna BPSK performs better for both perfect and imperfect CSI. Maximum permissible channel estimation error increases with the usage of more receiving antenna at the expense of increased cost.</h4>

                    <h4>In this work, a 5 state left to right HMM-based Bangla Isolated word speech recognizer has been developed. To train and test the recognizer, a small corpus of various sampling frequencies have been developed in noisy as well as the noiseless environment. The number of filter banks is varied during the feature extraction phase for both MFCC and PLP. The effects of 2nd and 3rd differential coefﬁcients have also been observed. Experimental results exhibit that MFCC based feature extraction technique is better in CLASSROOM environment on the contrary PLP based technique performs better not only in a noiseless environment but also in when AC or FAN noise is present. We have also noticed that higher sampling frequency and higher filter order don’t always help to improve the performance.</h4>

                      <h4>This paper has observed the effects of different coefficients for MFCC and PLP feature extraction techniques for Bangla corpus System. We have first observed the effects of 12 coefficients for every 10 ms frames, and then added the delta and accelerating coefficients to get 24 and 36 coefficient vectors per frame respectively. Then we have also observed the effect of appending the power coefficient and its first and second derivative while getting a 39 coefficient feature vector per frame. In addition, we have further appended 13 third differential coefficients to make a vector set of 52 coefficients per frame to observe the effect of third differential coefficients too. From the experimental results, we have observed that for gender unbiased models, delta addition has shown the maximum detection both for speaker dependent and independent system. But for speaker independent gender biased models, acceleration, power, and third differential coefficients addition have increased the detection for both MFCC and PLP in noise-free audio samples with the sampling rate of 44.1 KHz.</h4>
